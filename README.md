# SFML-Double-Jump
A simple game created to improve my programming skills using C++ and SFML. Any feedback would be appreciated

## Description
The objective of the game is to "double jump" to stay inside the window whilst using the mouse to shoot down the enemies that are chasing you.

## Compiling
The best method would be to use Visual Studio 2015 

1. Download the ZIP file and extract the files
2. Open solution file (.sln)
3. [Configure Visual Studio Environment to run SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php)
4. Make sure to build solution for 32-bit
