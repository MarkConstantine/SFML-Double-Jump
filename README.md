# SFML-Double-Jump
A simple game created to improve my programming skills using C++ and SFML 2.4.1. Any feedback would be appreciated

## Description
The objective of the game is to "double jump" to stay inside the window whilst using the mouse to shoot down the enemies that are chasing you.

## Compiling
The best method would be to use Visual Studio 2015 

1. Download the ZIP file and extract the files
2. Open solution file (.sln)
3. [Configure Visual Studio Environment to run SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php)
4. Make sure to build solution for 32-bit

## Final Remarks
This project is definitely not perfect, but it is what I consider to be "finished". Despite the fact that there are some small bugs (which is common in any game), the core of the game is fully functioning. This was a small project designed to improve my skills in game programming and programming in general (specifically in C++ and SFML). Overall, I'm quite happy with its current state which means I wont be updating it any further. However, feel free to download and play around with it on your own.
